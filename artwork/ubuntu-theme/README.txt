This is the Ubuntu theme for Drupal 4.7.
This is the first version of ubuntu07.

Created by Matthew Nuzum of Canonical, Ltd.

Please note that this Drupal theme has restrictions on how you may use it since it contains trademarks that are the property of Canonical.

To use this theme with Drupal 4.7, just copy this folder to your themes folder. The paths in this theme assume that drupal is installed at www.yoursite.org/ and NOT at www.yoursite.org/Something/. If you have drupal installed into a subdirectory, you may need to change a few paths.

This theme uses the mootools 1.0 javascript library that will cause conflicts with the 5.x series of drupal themes. It should be easy to port to drupal 5 by either enabling jquery's compabitility mode or by porting the theme to jquery, which shouldn't be hard. Please share your changes if you do make this port.

The most prominant feature of the site is the "header" or "masthead" across the top of the page. The graphics for this are included here, but the masthead is actually created by using "blocks" in drupal. You can view the source of the ubuntu.com website to see what you need to paste into your block to mirror this functionality.

Also note that there is a Photoshop PSD file and a Gimp XCF file that you can use to create your own masthead graphics. These files are located in the src folder.

COPYING - Important, read this please

For official, Ubuntu related sites, you may use this Drupal theme and
graphics, including CD cover artwork either as provided or with any
changes you like. Our suggestion is to leave the logo image intact and
simply add the name of your website at the bottom right of the logo. 
However, you have the freedom to do whatever you decide works best.

For those sites that are not officially recognized by Canonical as
Ubuntu related sites, you may use this theme as a basis for your own
design, however you must change the graphics and look of the theme so as
not to imply any form of endorsement or affiliation with the Ubuntu
project or with Canonical. 

Please note that the trademark guidelines for the Ubuntu logo and Ubuntu
or Canonical trademarks still apply. Other logos and graphics used on
the Ubuntu website but not included in this theme have a separate
license and cannot be used without explicit permission. Also, this theme
contains icons that are part of the Tango project. These icons may be
used according to their license, which is Creative Commons by-sa and can
